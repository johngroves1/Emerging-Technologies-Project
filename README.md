# Emerging Technologies 4th Year Project

**Student ID:** G00367771

# Introduction
For this module I was instructed to research and demonstrate three scikit-learn algorithms as well as researching quantum computing and the Deutschs Algorithm.

A README should be included with the following content:
* A description of this repository and its contents
* Instructions stating how to run the notebooks


# Contents of the notebook
### Scikit-Learn Notebook
* A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library
* Demonstrate of three interesting algorithms
* Appropriate plots and other visualisations

### Scikit-Learn Notebook
* A clear and concise comparison of quantum computing and classical computing
* An explenation of Deutsch's algorithm
* Deutsch's algorithm simulated using qiskit
